        Racers ascend from the base area up Warming House Hill, proceeding past the Painter Boy Lift
        base on Hous- ton trail. Upon reaching the “Five Way” intersection, racers may choose to
        transition to enable a skating tra- verse along the flat ridge leading to the top of Gold
        Link lift. Here racers begin a groomed decent on the North Pass ski slope, proceeding
        through the Prospect Tunnel, further exiting the resort boundary by descending into a steep
        and narrow gulch, arriving at the valley floor and the East River Checkpoint (Mile 4). On
        occasion, in overly warm conditions, the East River may be open to water flow. In order to
        proceed on course teammates must advance through all checkpoints in tandem.

        The route proceeds down valley, making a gradual ascending traverse to pass the
        Ambush Ranch Checkpoint (Mile 7.25). Here the race route turns up the Brush Creek drainage,
        continuing to a second creek crossing at West Brush Creek (Mile 8.75). A snow bridge is
        generally passable here, but can also be a wet crossing in some circumstances.

        The course climbs briefly until merging onto a narrowly sketched single-track, known as
        “Death
        Pass”, a .25 mile traverse skirting a steep, south facing escarpment.

        Sustained climbing begins in earnest beyond the Death Pass Checkpoint. The course continues
        beyond Middle Brush Creek, climbing through dense timber into the upper reaches of East
        Brush Creek and the Upper Brush Creek Checkpoint at 11,006 feet (Mile 15.5).
